                        I focus on building scalable UI systems that prioritize performance, accessibility, and clean component architecture. My approach combines design precision with engineering discipline to deliver production-ready frontend systems.

                    <p>
                        In a world saturated with templates and noise, I offer silence and precision. My work is defined not by what is added, but by what is removed. Every pixel serves a purpose; every interaction has a weight.
